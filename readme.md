## Absolute Units: 
  - Pixels (px)
  - pt, cm, mm, in, etc...

## Percentage Units:
  - Percentages are mainly used for widths
  - Relative to their parent (except on height, where things get weird)

## Relative Units: 
  There are two types of relative units: 
  - Relative to font-size
    - em and rem (and many other less common ones)
  - Relative to viewport
    - vw, vh, vmin, vmax
